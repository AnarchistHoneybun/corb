                After a couple months of college, with its endless new stimuli and utter lack of form (at least any with rigour enough to hold me), I<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a></sup> completely drifted away from the principal of my two hobbies, reading. A year or so more of CompSci education (although through no fault of the subject itself (well, a little)) and only going through course books, if any, however, had completely unmoored me (to say nothing of what the rest of college had done to liquefy my brain), and -- barely able to finish any long (or short) form lit now -- I needed an anchor, badly.

                CoRB (Cosmopolitan Review of Books (a shameless lift from NYRB<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a></sup> (currently my favourite publisher) (please do not sue me))) is an attempt at that, to atleast try and keep up with reading -- both because it's the most fun one can have without taking their clothes off, and I did not want to let my mind atrophy so much that one day looking around a little too hard would have it leak out through whatever crevice it found handy -- with friends (well, a friend (who, as of writing this, has not signed off (which I believe he gets to, as one of the founding members) on the name (or even the act of us (~)officially becoming a club(?)) and it would be hilarious if it gets struck down)). We pick out about 5 books, each, that we'd like to read, and veto up to 3 (which has led to me getting repeatedly snubbed on 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'); the rest get put on a wheel, spun to select the next read.
            </p>

                CoRB's logo (see above) is a couple of crossed muted post horns (Trystero's<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a></sup> symbol), though one's been unmuted. I would love to say that, in a way, it represents my own relationship with the works I read, where I rarely talk about them (the mute) and the club's purpose is to have people alongside who do (which, I suppose, is all true), but really it was just the structure of the symbol that was really interesting to me, and I did not want a symmetric logo.

                If you've made it this far (which is as far as we go, since I lost the thread of my thoughts a while ago and risk making this too freeform if I ramble any more) and any of this resonates, great! Proper channels for communication are still being set up -- links will be scattered around this page once they exist -- and I'd love to have you.
